trying to install scikit-cuda (looks like also comes with pycuda?)
kept getting 
[ gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory
    error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1 ]

sudo apt-get install g++

sudo apt-get install python-dev

sudo apt-get install gcc

echo $PATH
*see if \usr\local\bin\CUDA is on there

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64>                          ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

pip install scikit-cuda

*finally succeeded*
