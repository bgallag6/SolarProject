- download mpi4py from PyPI:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpi4py

either / both (don't remember)
- extract mpi4py compressed folder
- cd into extracted directory
- $ python setup.py install

- pip install mpi4py


Linux Mint 18:

- $ conda install mpi4py

# worked perfectly??

for whatever reason, that didn't work on the lab computer

- i had to install MPI from MPICH, and then install mpi4py?
