Installing mpi4py
=================

What I had tried months ago:
............................

- Tried installing OpenMP:

download tar.gz from https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v2.0/
shell$ gunzip -c openmpi-2.0.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
shell$ cd openmpi-2.0.1
shell$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
shell$ make all install

- couldn't get OpenMP working or conda installation of mpi4py

- installed MPICH

- $ pip intall mpi4py (finally worked)


What I tried now:
.................

When I execute:
$ mpiexec -n 10 python untitled10.py

I get error:
"from mpi4py import MPI
ImportError: libmpi.so.20: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

- when I initially entered: $ which mpicc
I got a blank line

- I did $ sudo apt install MPICH
downloaded a bunch of stuff, looked to be good

- now when $ which mpicc
I get "/usr/local/mpicc

- also $ which mpiexec
gives "/usr/local/mpiexec

- still get same error when try to run python script

- however, when run $ mpiexec -n 2 python -c "print 'Hello World'"
I get:
"Hello World
Hello World"

- could be path issues:
$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
gives {empty}
$ echo $PATH
gives {bunch of entries}

- tried $ ldconfig 
got: "/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can't create temporary cache file: ... Permission denied" 

- when do $ ls /usr/local
returns tons of entries, including multiple MPI entries - possibly conflicts between 
two installations or old/new installs?
